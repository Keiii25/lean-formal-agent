AgentHub: Market Intelligence Demo

This demonstration shows how to use AgentHub to create a comprehensive 
market intelligence system with minimal code. The example focuses on
crypto market analysis but can be adapted for any market research.

The demo showcases how AgentHub:
1. Simplifies tool creation and registration
2. Enables semantic tool discovery
3. Supports declarative agent workflows
4. Handles complex task dependencies
5. Provides real-time status updates

## Price Analysis
{asset} is currently trading at $67,245, up 1.26% in the last 24 hours. The price has formed a strong support level at $65,800 with resistance at $68,500.

## Volume Analysis
Trading volume has increased by 15% compared to the previous week, indicating growing market interest and potential for continued momentum.

## Social Sentiment
Social sentiment score is 0.35 (moderately positive) with a mention velocity of 237.5 mentions per hour. This represents a 12% increase from baseline.

## Correlation Analysis
Price-sentiment correlation is 0.67, showing strong alignment between social metrics and price movement over the analyzed timeframe.

## Risk Assessment
RSI is currently at 68, approaching overbought territory. Combined with resistance at $68,500, there's potential for short-term consolidation.

## Opportunity Assessment
The bull-bear ratio of 1.65 and growing social momentum suggest continued upside potential despite near-term resistance.

## Key Insights

1. The 15% increase in trading volume coupled with 0.35 sentiment score signals potential for a breakout above $68,500 resistance in the next 3-5 days.

2. Strong price-sentiment correlation (0.67) suggests monitoring social metrics for early signals, with any sentiment score above 0.5 likely preceding significant price movement.

3. Current engagement quality (0.72) is significantly higher than average (0.58), indicating high-quality interactions rather than just speculative noise.
